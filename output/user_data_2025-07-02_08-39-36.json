Conclusion oO O Oo\npanoramic stitching and\nobject detection\n\n1 Introduction Drones are widely used for security purposes, we present a UAV patrol system consisting of two m\n\nv Related work stitching module and object detection module. Specifically, the image stitching module generates a clear\n\n- yoton show eye view from the captured video by eliminating the ghosts caused by moving objects. Moreover, the ob\n\nelimination ule provides high detection accuracy with the aid of scene parsing results. The complete system produc\nrea Cast that covers the content of the video captured by UAV, in which the detected objects are visualized.\n\nveer eeg In the future, we will focus on improving the UAV patrol system. The current stitching module cannot deal with videos\n\narchitecture shot by a rotating drone which limits its application. Scene parsing techniques can be used with other detectors and may\n\nSSI SASS improve the speed of video detection by indicating which area can be left out in the detection approach. Furthermore, the\neimination combination of UAV patrol tasks and brain intelligence presents another promising research direction.\n\nVv 3.4 Object detection\n3.4.1 Scene\nparsing\n\n3.4.2 Quantifying\nthe object-scene\nrelationship\n3.4.3 Model\nstructure\n\nThickness\n\nShow all\n\n4 Experiments\n\nv 4.1 Dataset and\nexperiment settings\n\n4.1.1 Dataset\n4.1.2 Experiments Y.
