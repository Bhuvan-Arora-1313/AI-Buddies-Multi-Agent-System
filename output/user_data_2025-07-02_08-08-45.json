As the drone can fly over any objects\non the ground, these points serve as virtual locations for the user to be\nable to control flight segments and the frequency of visits by drones.\nHaving many (virtual) waypoints over the borderline (i.e., a higher\nresolution) can improve the accuracy of the model. But, it comes at the\ncost of a higher computational complexity for solving the optimization\nmodel. This is because, as the resolution increases, the corresponding\nnumber of variables in the optimization model increases significantly.\nThus, we aim to find a sufficient number of waypoints to have a\nreasonable trade-off between the model accuracy and the computational\ncomplexity.\n\nThe following assumptions are made to develop the optimization\nmodel:\n\n- The borderline will be divided into multiple border segments, and a\ndrone will be assigned to each segment. This action assists in con-\ntrolling the drones as well as avoiding the chances that more than\none drone will visit any one location and collision among the drones\n(Ahmadian, Lim, Torabbeigi, & Kim, 2019).\n\nEach location on the border has a pre-assigned revisiting gap. This\ngap may differ based on the location. The locations with higher\npriority are assigned a shorter revisiting gap in order to enhance\nsecurity.\n\nThe battery discharging rate is constant, but the charging efficiency\nis a function of the drone speed.\n\nIn addition to the above assumptions, we suggest two different\nspeeds during their flights: the nominal speed for normal operation and\nthe charging mode speed for flying while being charged (i.e., flying\nabove the E-line). To lessen the revisiting gap, drones should use their\n\nSEBeer\u00aeo\n\npriority of waypoints between i and E is higher e\nright sub-segment between E, and i. Hence, a sca\napproach is proposed to choose one of the Show all\npatterns, which results in the minimum revising\nrepeatedly following the pattern.\n\nWe define P as the set of possible scanning patterns for the drone to\nscan a given area. In Fig. 1, let t;, be the flight time between waypoint i\nand E), and t,, be the flight time between waypoint i and E>. Following a\nfixed flight pattern p, the drone\u2019s revising gap to a specific waypoint i\nmaybe different from one visit to the next. Our goal is to ensure that each\nwaypoint is visited as frequently as possible, which can be accomplished\nby minimizing the maximum gap among all possible revisiting gaps\ngenerated by a fixed scanning pattern. Let G;,(p) be the time interval\nbetween the k* and (k + 1)* visits bf waypoint i following pattern p \u20ac P,\na collection of all possible scanning patterns. Then, a maximum revis-\niting gap for waypoint i during the operation can be defined as G7\u201c (p) =\nMAX e112... Ry Gik(P):\n\nProposition 1 below shows that the minimum value of the maximum\nrevisiting gap can be achieved if a drone flies between the two endpoints\nand changes its direction only at the endpoints. Let G; be the minimum\n\nvalue of G\u2019\"\u2122 over all patterns: G; = minpepGj\"\u2122(p). We have:\n\nProposition 1. G; for waypoint i during the surveillance operation is\nachieved if the drone flies directly and repeatedly between two endpoints E,\nand E>, and G; = 2-max(t,,t,).\n\nProof. See Appendix B. 4\n\nWe use Proposition 1 to find optimal paths and eliminate the need for\npath planning in the optimization model, thus reducing the complexity\nof the model.
