The\nnumerical results show that five candidate solutions exist for this\nproblem.\n\nshows the candidate solutions that the decision-makers can\nconsider to achieve an optimal solution.\n\nTo obtain a better understanding of the results, let us arbitrarily\nchoose an E-line passing speed of 10.9 mph (i.e., V\u00b0 = 10.9).
