Because the virtual navigator is trained through the PPO\nalgorithm, its network structure is complex and has strong learning ability. The navigator receives environmental\ninformation to adjusts its behavior by the reward function. The reward function has multiple aspects, such as\nthe navigator\u2019s approach to the target area, the distance between the cluster center and the navigator and the\ncluster center avoiding obstacles, which ensures the navigation effect of the navigator so that the entire cluster\ncan complete the task more effectively. It also introduces the projection of the virtual navigator and obstacles,\noptimizes the control input of the cluster and enables the agent to better follow the navigator and avoid obstacles.\n\ne Light shows\nCargo transport in groups\n\nDefense swarms attacking together\nIn these cases, moving together like\nbirds is useful.\n\nSimulation effect\n\nFigure 10a\u2014c shows the GAZEBO simulation navigation performance of the drone swarm controlled by the EN-\n\nMASCA algorithm. The starting and ending points of the drone swarm are (1, 9, 0.15) and (15, 1, 0.1), which\n\nis marked by red dots and triangles. The positions of obstacles 1-6 are (1, 6, 0.5), (4, 5, 0.6), (4.2, 6.5, 0.6), (7,\n\u00bb\u00ae Key Point: 7.5, 0.6) and (10, 3, 0.8). The drones start from the starting point. First, the drone swarm bypasses obstacle 1\n\nand passes through it from its right side. Then the drone swarm sailed to obstacles 2 and 3. The two obstacles\n\nSwarm behavior + Always flying close. are closed in position, and the drone swarm bypassed the upper and lower paths to avoid the obstacle area.\n\nIt means they coordinate and cooperate.\nSometimes they spread out, sometimes they\n\nfly together\u2014it depends on the mission.\n\nDo you want me to explain how drones stay\n\nconnected when the \\V \u2018e dispersed?\ni a rs RK\n\nAsk anything\n\n+ 2 Tools Q\n\nChatGPT can make mistakes.

Before approaching the end, the drone swarm avoided obstacle 5 and passed\nfrom its right side. Finally, the drone swarm bypassed all obstacles and reached the end. During the entire\nnavigation process, the drone swarm constantly adjusted the flight altitude and direction to adapt to terrain\nchanges and avoid obstacles. Figure 10d shows the EN-MASCA algorithm iteration in the simulated navigation.\n\nScientific Reports |\n\n(2025) 15:9139 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-88145-7 nature portfolio\n\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/"
