It achieves fast path adjustment and efficient\nnavigation performance by introducing a virtual navigator model and reinforcement learning algorithms (DQN\nand PPO), especially in complex scenarios. Table 2 shows the comparison results between the EN-MASCA and\nanother two algorithms.\n\nAlthough this study simulated the basic terrain characteristics of a durian orchard, there are some limitations\ncompared to the real orchard scene. The terrain undulations and obstacle distribution in the simulated\nenvironment are designed based on average values and typical samples, and fail to fully cover the extreme terrain\nchanges that may occur in the orchard (such as steep slopes and deep gullies). There are irregularly distributed\nsoft soils or waterlogged areas in the real environment. These factors put higher requirements on the flight\ncontrol and path planning of the drone, which have not been fully reflected in the simulation. Although moving\nobstacles were added to the experiment to simulate a dynamic environment, the types and behavior patterns of\ndynamic obstacles are relatively limited. The moving obstacles in this experiment used a fixed speed and a simple\nlinear motion model, while nonlinear and irregular motion (such as random movement of people, animals, and\nmechanical equipment) may occur in reality. In order to narrow the gap between the experimental setting and the\nreal conditions, subsequent research will build a more complex and realistic simulation environment, including\nmore sophisticated terrain and obstacle modeling. It introduces experimental designs with multiple scenarios\nand multiple meteorological conditions to comprehensively evaluate the robustness and adaptability of the\nalgorithm. It also conducts long-term field tests to accumulate real data to optimize the algorithm performance.\n\nConclusions\n\nThis study proposes an enhanced multi-agent swarm control algorithm (EN-MASCA) for the coordinated patrol\noperation of drone swarms in durian orchards. It introduces DQN and PPO algorithms to optimize drones\u2019\nnavigation and obstacle avoidance strategies. It guides the drone swarm through the virtual navigator model\nto improve its adaptability and stability. It also constructs a six-degree-of-freedom drone motion simulation\nmodel and uses the PI control loop to achieve the attitude control of drone swarms. Compared with MASCA,\nNNCA and NSGAII algorithms, the results show that the EN-MASCA algorithm is superior to the other three\nalgorithms regarding flight trajectory, flight stability, cluster stability and simulation effect. The drone swarm\ncontrolled by the EN-MASCA algorithm can effectively avoid obstacles, maintain a tight formation and\ncomplete patrol tasks. Its speed, altitude and yaw angle change rate are closer to the expected value and have\nless fluctuation. The distance between the cluster center and the virtual navigator or obstacles remains stable,\n\nPreferences.\n\nScientific Reports |\n\n(202c) 1\u00a3:0120 | httos://doi.ora/10.1038/541598-025-88145-7 nature portfolio"
