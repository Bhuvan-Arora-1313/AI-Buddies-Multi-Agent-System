To control the maximum time interval between two consecutive flights to a particular\nel Lo section of the border, a permitted revisiting gap is assigned to each location on the border based on its criticality.\nA multi-objective mixed-integer non-linear programming (MINLP) model is developed to minimize both the total\nlength of the E-line system for the wireless charging system and the number of drones to satisfy the revisiting gap\nconstraint for a secure border patrol. A solution algorithm is proposed to achieve the Pareto-optimal set. This\nmethod provides the decision-maker with a set of candidate solutions to choose from based on their priorities and\n\nbudgetary constraints. We illustrate our method using a case study on a segment of the US-Mexico borderline.\n\nSG0OcGeGSBE2S OOF E\u00ae*\n\n5 Conclusion\n\nAppendix A E-line\nsystem on border line\n\nAppendix B Proof of\nProposition 1\n\nReferences"
