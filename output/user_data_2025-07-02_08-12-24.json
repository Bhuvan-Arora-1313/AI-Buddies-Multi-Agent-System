Numerical results\n\nThe case study results are generated by implementing .\nIn other words, provides an initial solution and conse-\nquently helps to solve the proposed optimization model (5).\nis implemented to find the candidate optimal solutions to the problem.\nThe speed margin for the critical speed is set to 0.1 mph (i.e., ey = 0.1),\nmeaning that the actual critical speeds are within 0.1 mph from our\nfindings. The minimum and maximum speeds for the drone are set to 1\nmph and 30 mph, respectively. depicts the effect of different\nquantities of V\u00b0 on the optimal number of drones (7) and the total length\nof the E-line (\u00a3). The range of the required number of drones falls be-\ntween 10 and 14 for various values of the E-line passing speeds. The\nnumerical results show that five candidate solutions exist for this\nproblem.\n\nshows the candidate solutions that the decision-makers can\nconsider to achieve an optimal solution.\n\nTo obtain a better understanding of the results, let us arbitrarily\nchoose an E-line passing speed of 10.9 mph (i.e., V\u00b0 = 10.9). As shown\nin column CS3 in , this speed is considered a critical speed. The\noptimal number of drones and the optimal length of the E-line are 12 and\n2.83 miles, respectively.
