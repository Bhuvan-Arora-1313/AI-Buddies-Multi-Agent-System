In this paper, we implement the wireless charging approach to\nachieve a non-stop drone operation.\n\nAlthough drones have been the subject of many studies, few studies\nhave focused on the implementation of the drone for border surveil-\nlance. A drawback of using small drones for continuous surveillance is\nthe flight time limitation due to the current battery technology. To\naddress this issue, have proposed a new concept to\n\ncharge drones using an electrification line (E-line). In their proposed\napproach, the batteries connected along the E-lines use a renewable\nenergy source to store and produce electricity. The stored electricity is\nwirelessly transmitted to a drone\u2019s battery through E-lines\u2019 inverter\ndevice, coiled lines, and the drone\u2019s rectifier device consecutively (see\n\nN. Ahmadian et al.\n\nlimitation of a drone proves to be one of the main obstacles to a\ncontinuous flight time. In most cases, the battery duration of a small-size\ndrone does not exceed 30 min. To address this problem, we propose to\nuse the E-line system ( ), which can charge drones\nwirelessly. The E-line system with an appropriate length will charge the\ndrones during their surveillance, enable a continuous and seamless flight\nover the border, and eliminate the need for battery charging depots. This\nwork provides an optimization model to determine the optimal number\nof drones, the optimal length of the E-line, and the optimal location of\n\nproblem description, assumptions that are requ\noptimization model, and the problem formulat\nthe solution approach, including the propositio @ eee\nwe implemented to solve the model and improjgimneares\n\nefficiency.
