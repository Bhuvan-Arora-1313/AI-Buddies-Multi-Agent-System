Introduction\n\nDue to their increasing popularity, di s are widely used for security purposes, such as\npatrols, now. There are two key issues in drone patrol: 1) showing the patrolling scene in a\nsimple and intuitive manner; 2) detecting and highlighting objects of interest. To this end,\nwe propose a UAV patrol system based on panoramic image stitching and object detection.\nThis system uses the SPHP algorithm combined with the region growing algorithm based\non difference images to generate a panorama image and to eliminate motion ghosts. It fur-\nther adopts the popular image object detector Faster RCNN to detect objects while using\nknowledge about the scene categories to refine the classification scores of the objects. The\nproposed system is evaluated on the VisDrone video detection dataset. The experiments\nshow that the system provides good results regarding panoramic stitching and object de-\ntection in drone videos.\n\n\u00a9 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.\n\nIn recent years, a rapid development of drones and their applications to a wide range of domains could be observed\nBesides transporting items for express delivery or spraying insecticides in agricultural applications, drones are widely used\nto carry cameras to capture photos and videos of certain areas. Thus, drones, similar to other unmanned machines, have\n\n. Drones have a great"
