You can create a key for free with a few clicks in Google Al Studio.\n\nmodels\nPricing Once you have an API key, you have the following options to connect to the Gemini API:\nRate limits\nBilling info \u00a2 Setting your API key as an environment variable\n\ne Providing your API key explicitly\nModel Capabilities\n\nFor initial testing, you can hard code an API key, but this should only be temporary since it's not secure. You can find examples for hard coding\nthe API key in Providing API key explicitly section.\n\nText generation\nImage generation\nVideo generation\nSpeech generation A . . .\nSetting API key as environment variable\n\nMusic generation A\n\nLong context\n\nStructured output\nThinking\n\nFunction calling\nDocument understanding\nImage understanding\nVideo understanding\nAudio understanding\n\nCode execution\n\nURL context A\n\nIf you set the environment variable GEMINI_API_KEY or GOOGLE_API_KEY , the API key will automatically be picked up by the client when using\none of the Gemini API libraries. It's recommended that you set only one of those variables, but if both are set, GOOGLE_API_KEY takes\nprecedence.\n\nIf you're using the REST API, or JavaScript on the browser, you will need to provide the API key explicitly.\n\nHere is how you can set your API key locally as the environment variable GEMINI_API_KEY with different operating systems.\nLinux/macOS - Bash macOS - Zsh Windows\n\nBash is a common Linux and macOS terminal configuration.
