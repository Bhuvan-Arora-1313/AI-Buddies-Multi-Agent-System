Smart\nborder patrol using small-size drones may provide significant help in patrolling areas inaccessible to patrol\nagents, reduce agent response time, and increase the safety of patrol agents working in dangerous regions.\nHowever, the short flight duration associated with small-size drones due to battery limitation can be a serious\ndrawback for such a system for seamless surveillance. Therefore, this paper proposes a drone-based continuous\nsurveillance system for border patrol with a dynamic wireless battery charging system that is built onto an\nelectrification line (E-line). To control the maximum time interval between two consecutive flights to a particular\nsection of the border, a permitted revisiting gap is assigned to each location on the border based on its criticality.\nA multi-objective mixed-integer non-linear programming (MINLP) model is developed to minimize both the total\nlength of the E-line system for the wireless charging system and the number of drones to satisfy the revisiting gap\nconstraint for a secure border patrol. A solution algorithm is proposed to achieve the Pareto-optimal set. This\nmethod provides the decision-maker with a set of candidate solutions to choose from based on their priorities and\nbudgetary constraints. We illustrate our method using a case study on a segment of the US-Mexico borderline.\n\nSG0OcGeGSBE2S OOF E\u00ae*"
