There are two key issues in drone patrol: 1) showing the patrolling scene in a\na epereacnite Accented 1 9 ceptembe oor simple and intuitive manner; 2) detecting and highlighting objects of interest. To this end,\n\u00a5 4.1 Dataset and Available online 24 October 2019 we propose a UAV patrol system based on panoramic image stitching and object detection.\nASTUTE aT This system uses the SPHP algorithm combined with the region growing algorithm based\nha \u2014 Keywords: on difference images to generate a panorama image and to eliminate motion ghosts.
