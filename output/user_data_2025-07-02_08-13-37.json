Numerical experiments\n\nThis section details a case study and the numerical results of the\nproposed model (5). A sensitivity analysis is performed in Section 4.3 to\nunderstand the model behavior considering the different number of\nwaypoints and side goals associated with this model.\n\n4.1. Case study\n\nA segment of the U.S.-Mexico borderline spanning 22.8 miles and\nlocated between two border crossings is considered for the case study in\nthis section. This borderline is located within the Cochise County limits\nin Arizona (Fig. 4). The west side of the borderline is located at the\nborder crossing in Naco, Arizona (Point A), and the east side is located at\nthe crossing in Douglas, Arizona (Point B).\n\nsciencedirectassets.com wy\n\nC Cast study rtst ait YCnmCratCu Dy\n\nIn other words, Algorithm 2 provides an initijigheliehiscset,\n\nquently helps to solve the proposed optimization\nis implemented to find the candidate optimal so\nThe speed margin for the critical speed is set to 0\nmeaning that the actual critical speeds are wit\nfindings. The minimum and maximum speeds fo\nmph and 30 mph, respectively. Fig. 6 depicts Mel\n\nquantities of V\u00b0 on the optimal number of drones (7) and the total leng\nof the E-line (\u00a3). The range of the required number of drones falls be-\ntween 10 and 14 for various values of the E-line passing speeds. The\nnumerical results show that five candidate solutions exist for this\nproblem.\n\nTable 3 shows the candidate solutions that the decision-makers can\nconsider to achieve an optimal solution.\n\nTo obtain a better understanding of the results, let us arbitrarily\nchoose an E-line passing speed of 10.9 mph (i.e., V\u00b0 = 10.9). As shown\nin column CS3 in Table 3, this speed is considered a critical speed. The\noptimal number of drones and the optimal length of the E-line are 12 and\n2.83 miles, respectively. The segments corresponding to each drone and\nthe locations of the installed E-line are presented in Tables 4 and 5,\nrespectively. Drones are assigned to border segments with different\nlengths. For instance, Drone 3 is designated to cover waypoints 39 to 67\nwith a length of 3.192 miles and has an average given revisiting gap of\n18.41 min. Drone 9 is designated to cover a segment spanning 1.026\nmiles and has a permitted revisiting gap of 5.4 min. This demonstrates\nthat the segments that have waypoints with shorter given revisiting gaps\nare shorter than the segments with longer given revisiting gaps\n(Table 4).\n\nThickness\n\n4.3. Sensitivity analysis\n\nThis section analyzes the model behavior by changing some\nparameter values as well as the objective function of the model."
