Introduction\n\nUnmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), commonly known as \u201cdrones,\u201d\nare becoming a more accessible alternative to performing tasks that are\nusually operated by crewed vehicles. Drones have applications in\nvarious areas such as delivery (\n\n), damage assessment (\n), search and rescue (\n), healthcare (\n), military purposes (\n), and border surveillance (\n\n). Accommodating cameras, sensors, and other\ninformation-gathering equipment allow drones the opportunity to pro-\nvide high-quality information about the surveilled area. Hence, drones\ncan be of significant help in monitoring areas where human intervention\nis risky, expensive, or hardly possible. Specifically, in response to tough\n\n* Corresponding author.\nE-mail addresses:\n\n(N. Ahmadian),\n\nenvironmental factors posed within national border areas, drones can\nfacilitate border monitoring by simultaneously allowing fewer agent\ndeployments and maintaining counter intrusion detection (\n\n). Drones can fill the gap in the current border surveillance\nsystem by (1) improving coverage along remote sections, (2) providing\nreal-time information to the control operator for quicker response, and\n(3) reducing the risk of agent endangerment.\n\nThe use of drones for border surveillance began in 1990 along the U.\nS.-Mexico border in Texas ( ). The goal of the mission\nwas drug interdiction ( ). Since 2005, U.S.\nCustoms and Border Protection (CBP) has operated a version of the\nmilitary drone, Predator B, along the border (\n\n). From 2013 to 2016, Predator B\nwas operated a total of approximately 5,000 h per year, which was only\naround 7% of the total available hours needed for border monitoring\n( ). These types of drones are very powerful but are\nalso very expensive. Hence, using such drones is not applicable for ar-\nranging highly frequent flights to every location on the border. As an\nalternative, small-size drones with multi-rotors are less expensive and a\n\n(G.J.
