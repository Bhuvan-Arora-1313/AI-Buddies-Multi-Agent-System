It suffices to show that 2-max(t,, t,) is both a lower bound and an upper bound for G; , and it is achieved by selecting the scanning pattern, in\nwhich the drone simply flies directly between E; and E2 and changes the direction only at the endpoints. If a drone travels between the two endpoints\nE, and Ep directly and continuously, for every waypoint i located in that segment, the maximum gap occurs when the drone leaves and flies to the\nfurthest endpoint of the line and then returns. The flight time from waypoint i to the furthest endpoint of the segment is max(t;,t,), and the direct flight"
