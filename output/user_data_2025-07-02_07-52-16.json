Its multi-layer control framework (integrating Pl\nloops, PX\u00e94 flight stack, and bio-inspired swarming dynamics) represents a significant\nadvancement for scalable, real-time drone swarm coordination in unstructured\nenvironments.\n\n1.9. AUAV Patrol System Using Panoramic Stitching and Object\nDetection\n\nNovember 2019\n\nJournal :Computers & Electrical Engineering\nPublisher: Elsevier\n\nGoogle Scholar Link\n\nSummary\n\nThis paper presents a UAV-based patrol system that addresses two key challenges in drone\nsurveillance: how to create a complete view of the monitored area, and how to detect important\nobjects within that view. The system first generates a stitched panoramic image from drone\nvideo footage using SPHP and a region-growing algorithm that reduces motion ghosting. It then\napplies Faster R-CNN for object detection, enhanced using scene classification and parsing,\nallowing for more accurate bounding box predictions. Evaluations on the VisDrone ECCV 2018\ndataset demonstrate that this two-stage system produces high-quality panoramic views and\nimproved detection accuracy.\n\nHighlight\n\nThe key strength of this paper lies in its combination of panoramic video stitching and\ndeep-learning-based object detection, which provides both situational awareness and tactical\nprecision in surveillance. The use of scene-aware scoring refinement improves detection\nbeyond raw neural outputs, offering better performance in cluttered or complex drone footage.\n\n28O@eSE2S ODL E*\n\n@ Wed Jul 2 7:52AM\n\nVv\n\niS) \u00a9 4\n\n\u00a9 \u00a9 A&Share ~ &\n\n@ Editing v A"
