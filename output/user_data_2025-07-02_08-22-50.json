Introduction\n\nIn recent years, a rapid development of drones and their applications to a wide range of domains could be observed [1].\nBesides transporting items for express delivery or spraying insecticides in agricultural applications, drones are widely used\nto carry cameras to capture photos and videos of certain areas. Thus, drones, similar to other unmanned machines, have\nbeen used extensively to gather intelligence, to record events and to capture landscape images [2-4]. Drones have a great\npotential for patrolling applications, as they may conduct autonomous as well manual flights. Moreover, commercial home\nsurveillance solutions based on drones have already been presented.\n\nApart from the battery lifetime, there are other key problems when using drones for patrolling tasks: In order to obey\nregulations regarding the flight altitude, drones are required to fly below a certain altitude. This comes at the cost of in-\ncomplete images, as the whole area of interest may not be captured in single image from a low altitude. Nevertheless, an\noverall view of the patrolling area is required. For this reason, stitching approaches are used to create panorama images\nusing the video frames captured by the drone. In case a human operator is absent, the drone needs to switch to autopilot\naccording to the direction of the target of interest. Locations of significant objects should be highlighted in the captured\n\n* This paper is for regular issues of CAEE.
