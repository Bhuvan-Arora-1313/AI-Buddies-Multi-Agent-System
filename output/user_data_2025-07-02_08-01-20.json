The E-line system with an appropriate length will charge the\ndrones during their surveillance, enable a continuous and seamless flight\nover the border, and eliminate the need for battery charging depots. This\nwork provides an optimization model to determine the optimal number\nof drones, the optimal length of the E-line, and the optimal location of\nthe E-line system required for border surveillance. The optimization\nmodel will minimize the total length of the E-line system as well as the\ntotal number of drones for the operation. To enhance the awareness of\nthe system and the security of the border, providing frequent flights to\nevery location on the border is essential. Locations having a higher\nchance of being penetrated by intruders should hold a higher priority\nand should be monitored more frequently. This is handled in our pro-\nposed optimization model by introducing the concept of revisiting gap,\nwhich is defined as the time interval between two consecutive visits to a\nparticular point of the border. We assume that every location|on the\nborder is assigned its priority level, which helps determine the frequency\nof visits to the location. Hence, a permitted revisiting gap can be inter-\npreted as the time interval a drone can be away from a particular\nlocation during the surveillance operation, and it is given to the opti-\nmization model as an input parameter.\n\nBorders form continuous lines and may not have physical waypoints\nor breakpoints at every location. Hence, we assume equally-spaced\nwaypoints distributed over the borderline for the convenience of\ndeveloping a mathematical model. As the drone can fly over any objects\non the ground, these points serve as virtual locations for the user to be\nable to control flight segments and the frequency of visits by drones.\nHaving many (virtual) waypoints over the borderline (i.e., a higher\nresolution) can improve the accuracy of the model. But, it comes at the\ncost of a higher computational complexity for solving the optimization\nmodel. This is because, as the resolution increases, the corresponding\nnumber of variables in the optimization model increases significantly.\nThus, we aim to find a sufficient number of waypoints to have a\nreasonable trade-off between the model accuracy and the computational\n\nfinding the optimal scanning pattern of each\nphase is to determine the remaining variables\npatterns.\n\nHighlight colour\n\n@\u00a9@ee0ee0e\n\nThickness\n\n2.1. Phase I: scanning pattern determination\n\nShow all\n\nSince the borderline is divided into multiple DOrde\ndrone is assigned to each segment, each drone\u2019s flight range is limited to\nbetween the two endpoints (E; and E2) of its segment (see Fig. 1).\nConsider waypoint i located between E, and Ep. Let 4; denote the dis-\ntance between waypoint i and E;, and y; be the distance between way-\npoint i and E2. Each segment consists of several waypoints, and each of\nthe waypoints may be associated with a different priority in terms of the\nrisk level for penetration. There can be numerous scanning patterns for\ndrone surveillance for the segment, especially, when there are multiple\nwaypoints and the priority level (i.e., risk) of each waypoint differs from\neach other. We define a scanning pattern of a drone as a routine sequence\nof drone flights that leaves a starting point, scans the segment, and\nreturns back to the starting point to complete one flight cycle, which will\nbe repeated by the drone during the assigned surveillance operation\nperiod. Some example scanning patterns include\nPi := <1i-E, -i\u2014E, \u2014-E, -i>,p2 := < E, -i\u2014E,) \u2014i\u2014E, \u2014i\u2014-E, >, and\np3 := <i\u2014E,\u2014i-\u2014E, \u2014i>. Patterns p; and p2 can be appealing if the\npriority of waypoints between i and E, is higher than the priority for the\nright sub-segment between E; and i. Hence, a scanning pattern selection\napproach is proposed to choose one of the many possible scanning\npatterns, which results in the minimum revising gap for a drone to fly\nrepeatedly following the pattern.\n\nWe define ? as the set of possible scanning patterns for the drone to\nscan a given area. In Fig. 1, let t;, be the flight time between waypoint i\nand E), and t,, be the flight time between waypoint i and E>. Following a\nfixed flight pattern p, the drone\u2019s revising gap to a specific waypoint i\nmaybe different from one visit to the next. Our goal is to ensure that each\n\n*EBE2O \u00a984 GE"
