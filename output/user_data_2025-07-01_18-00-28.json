It enables drone swarms to learn and optimize flight\npaths, avoid collisions and misjudgments and complete large-scale patrol tasks quickly, which reduces the labor\nintensity and costs of manual patrols and improves patrol efficiency and safety. Moreover, it enables the drone to\nrespond quickly, detect abnormal conditions and send alerts to managers promptly, which provides the accurate\nlocation information to help managers respond quickly, ultimately improving the economic benefits of the\ndurian orchard.\n\nData availability\n\nThe datasets generated and analyzed during the current study are not publicly available due to [privacy con-\ncerns] but are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.
