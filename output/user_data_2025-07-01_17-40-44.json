Its management and maintenance\n\nDefense swarms attacking together require efficient patrol operations to ensure the healthy growth and high yield of durian\u2019. However, since durian\norchards usually have large area, much manpower must be invested in patrolling especially the peak periods.\nIn addition, the cost of agricultural labor is rising year by year, which causes higher costs of relying on manual\npatrols of durian orchards. It is also difficult to ensure full coverage of the entire durian orchard, which will miss\nsome areas and affects the patrol effect. The environment of durian orchard is large, so manual patrols require\nlong walks, which consumes a lot of physical strength\u201d. With the application of drone technology in agriculture,\ndurian orchards have also begun to try to use drones for patrol operations. Drones can cover large areas quickly,\n. provide high-resolution real-time images and data and improve the patrol efficiency and accuracy. However,\n* Key Point: the drone patrol operations also have some problems. The autonomous flight path planning and navigation\naccuracy of drone swarms is insufficient, which is easy to deviate from the planned route or fail to cover all target\nareas\u2019. Due to the complex terrain of the durian orchard, the drone swarm needs to fly at different altitudes,\nIt means they coordinate and cooperate. which increases the difficulty of path planning. The weather conditions (such as wind speed, wind direction\nSometimes they spread out, sometimes they and rainfall) will also affect the flight stability of the drone swarm, which causes the flight trajectory deviation,\nmutual interference and collisions. So drone swarms need to calculate and optimize paths to cope with changes\n\nIn these cases, moving together like\n\nbirds is useful.\n\n\u00ab Swarm behavior # Always flying close.\n\nfly together\u2014it depends on the mission.\n\n1Department of Electrical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia.\n\n; ?Department of Computer Science and Technology, School of Information Engineering, Shanghai Maritime\n\nDo you want me to explain how drones stay University, No. 1550, Haigang Avenue, Nanhui New Town, Pudong New Area, Shanghai, China. 7Department\n\nconnected when the \\ \u2018e dispersed? of Civil Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia. \u201cemail:\n22057874 @siswa.um.edu.my\n\ni a mia =~ a\n\nGlos aysallig Scientific Reports] (2025) 15:9139 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-88145-7 nature portfolio\n\n+ 2 Tools Q\n\nChatGPT can make mistakes.
