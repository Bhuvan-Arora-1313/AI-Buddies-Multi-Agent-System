The network structure of PPO algorithm.\n\nD= Dapproach _ Dobstacle + Detuster (22)\n\nIn Formula (22), Dapproach represents the reward for shortening the distance between the drone and the\ntarget point; Dobstacle represents the penalty for approaching obstacles; Deiuster represents the reward for\nmaintaining an appropriate distance and formation with neighboring drones. Based on the reward mechanism\nof the above cruise path, it controls the virtual navigator to avoids obstacles and navigates, which receives the\ncluster\u2019s detection information of the environment and forms an interactive network with the drone cluster. The\nphase feedback makes drone swarms adapt to the complex and changing environments, as shown in Fig. 4.\nThis stud uses the PPO algorithm to control the virtual navigator\u2019. As the guide of the drone cluster,\nthe virtual navigator adjusts the patrol path according to environmental information and provides dynamic\nreference points for the cluster. This study first uses the DQN algorithm to adjust the position of the virtual\nnavigator so that it can adapt to the dynamic environment and avoid obstacles in real time. It also broadcasts the\nvirtual navigator\u2019s target information to each drone through real-time communication to ensure that the cluster\ncan respond quickly to environmental changes. Its network structure is shown in Fig. 5. It has two networks;\nthe Critic network architecture first processes the input LSTM layer with 128 hidden units; the fully connected\nlayer of 128-bit hidden units uses the TanH layer as its activation function\u201d\u00ae. The FC layer consists of hidden\nlayer units and TanH activation function. The Actor network is composed of the neural network and normal\ndistribution, which has the 128-unit LSTM, FC and TanH layer. Its output is the mean of a normal distribution\nand the variance matrix is C = 0.05 I, where I is the identity matrix and the behavior is obtained from this\ndistribution. The output of the Actor is to obtain the velocity vector of navigators. So this study designs the\noutput of the Actor-network, which makes the projection of the ball radius on the three-dimensional axis as the\n\nScientific Reports |\n\n(2025) 15:9139\n\n| https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-88145-7 nature portfolio"
