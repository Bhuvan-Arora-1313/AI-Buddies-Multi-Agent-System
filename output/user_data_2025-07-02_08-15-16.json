Multiple objectives\n\nAs discussed in Section 3, by fixing the E-line passing speed, the\nlength of the E-line can be eliminated from the objective function. This\nchanges the objective function by including only the number of drones.\nResults are also affected in the sense that a broad range of optimal so-\nlutions is now found. Thus, another term can be included in the objective\nfunction as a side goal. In Eq. , the summation of the revisiting gaps\nof all waypoints is added to the objective function in order to find a low-\nrisk solution. Nonetheless, this side goal is replaceable by other terms\nbased on the preference of the decision-makers.
