The stages and challenges posed during the entire phase are designed to give the\nparticipants a flavor of relevant and interesting problems from the ecommerce ecosystem,\nassessing you on your problem solving, critical thinking, technical aptitude, and coding skills.\n\n* Round 1: Screening\n\nThe registered candidates will undergo a screening process where their academic performance\nand consistency, along with non-academic achievements and other accolades will be considered.\nThe shortlisted candidates will proceed to the next stage.\n\n* Round 2: Coding Assessment\n\nThe shortlisted candidates will then appear for a proctored coding assessment that will consist of\n3 questions to be attempted in 90 minutes, covering languages like Python, Java, C, C++ etc.. The\nscores will be calculated based on the clearance of test cases for these questions, and the ones\nwhich are equal to or higher than the cutoff score will move to the next round.\n\n* Round 3: Case Study-based Code\n\nThe shortlisted candidates will receive a business problem statement of Flipkart and will be asked\nto solve the same through Tech. This will require you to build a tool or system level solution for the\nproposed problem, and share the code for the same. The detailed brief of the round will be given\nto the relevant participants when the round will go live.\n\n* Round 4: National Finals\n\nThe Top 48 candidates will be selected for the grand finale round, and will be invited to the Flipkart\nHeadquarters in Bangalore, for the final evaluation. The selected candidates will be asked to form\nteams of 4, develop a prototype based on the solutions submitted by them in the previous round,\nand come prepared with a live demo of the working prototype. The Flipkart leadership jury will\nevaluate them based on the same, and the top 6 teams (24 candidates) will be awarded. The\n\naBese O\u00a98be@ B\u00ae\n\n@ Wed Jul 2 7:49AM\n\nVv\n\n&)"
