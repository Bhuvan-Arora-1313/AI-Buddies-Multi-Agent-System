Different\nfrom traditional algorithms that only rely on fixed path planning, the virtual navigator model\nsignificantly improves the flexibility and stability of the drone swarm in complex environments. It\n\nalso applies deep reinforcement learning algorithms to path planning and obstacle avoidance of\n\ndrone swarms for the first time, improving the algorithm\u2019s adaptability and optimization capabilities\nby learning dynamic information in complex environments. This innovation significantly improves\n\nthe applicability of existing methods in complex terrain and dynamic obstacle environments.\n\nFinally, it incorporates the simulation characteristics of biological swarm behavior, and on this basis,\ncomprehensively optimizes the flight path, obstacle avoidance and swarm stability of the drone\nswarm. By improving control strategies and parameter design, it improves the trajectory consistency\nand mission completion efficiency of the UAV swarm during flight. In the experimental part, this\n\nstudy verified in detail the advantages of the EN-MASCA algorithm in terms of flight trajectory, flight\nstability, cluster consistency and task completion efficiency by constructing a six-degree-of-freedom\nUAV motion simulation model and real environment simulation. It provides an efficient and intelligent\nsolution for collaborative patrol operations of drones in durian orchards, which has important practical\napplication value and promotion prospects.\n\nKeywords Drone swarm, Patrol operation, Durian orchard, Multi-agent swarm control algorithm, Path\nplanning, Obstacle avoidance strategy, Deep reinforcement learning, Virtual navigator model\n\nThe durian orchard is a large-area and high-density agricultural plantation. Its management and maintenance\nrequire efficient patrol operations to ensure the healthy growth and high yield of durian\u2019. However, since durian\norchards usually have large area, much manpower must be invested in patrolling especially the peak periods.\nIn addition, the cost of agricultural labor is rising year by year, which causes higher costs of relying on manual\npatrols of durian orchards. It is also difficult to ensure full coverage of the entire durian orchard, which will miss\nsome areas and affects the patrol effect. The environment of durian orchard is large, so manual patrols require\nlong walks, which consumes a lot of physical strength\u201d. With the application of drone technology in agriculture,\ndurian orchards have also begun to try to use drones for patrol operations. Drones can cover large areas quickly,\nprovide high-resolution real-time images and data and improve the patrol efficiency and accuracy. However,\nthe drone patrol operations also have some problems. The autonomous flight path planning and navigation\naccuracy of drone swarms is insufficient, which is easy to deviate from the planned route or fail to cover all target\n\nareas\u2019. Due to the complex terrain of the durian orchard, the drone swarm needs to fly at different altitudes,\nwathich increacec the difficulty af nath nlanning The weather canditiane (eich ac wind eneed wind directinn"
