Ahmadian et al.\n\nlimitation of a drone proves to be one of the main obstacles to a\ncontinuous flight time. In most cases, the battery duration of a small-size\ndrone does not exceed 30 min. To address this problem, we propose to\nuse the E-line system (Kim & Lim, 2018), which can charge drones\nwirelessly. The E-line system with an appropriate length will charge the\ndrones during their surveillance, enable a continuous and seamless flight\nover the border, and eliminate the need for battery charging depots. This\nwork provides an optimization model to determine the optimal number\nof drones, the optimal length of the E-line, and the optimal location of\nthe E-line system required for border surveillance. The optimization\nmodel will minimize the total length of the E-line system as well as the\ntotal number of drones for the operation. To enhance the awareness of\nthe system and the security of the border, providing frequent flights to\nevery location on the border is essential. Locations having a higher\nchance of being penetrated by intruders should hold a higher priority\nand should be monitored more frequently. This is handled in our pro-\nposed optimization model by introducing the concept of revisiting gap,\nwhich is defined as the time interval between two consecutive visits to a\nparticular point of the border. We assume that every location on the\n\nE8820 Oe i*\u00ae\n\nTo enhance the security of the nation\u2019s [Rimears\ncontinuous flight of small drones over its e\n\nShow all\n\nComputers & Industrial Engineering 164 (2022) 107891\n\nscanning patterns for all drones alone is a combinatorial optimization\nproblem, which is often difficult to solve. Therefore, we propose a two-\nphase sequential optimization approach. The first phase focuses on\nfinding the optimal scanning pattern of each drone, and the second\nphase is to determine the remaining variables for the given scanning\npatterns.\n\n2.1. Phase I: scanning pattern determination\n\nSince the borderline is divided into multiple border segments and a\ndrone is assigned to each segment, each drone\u2019s flight range is limited to\nbetween the two endpoints (E; and E,) of its segment (see Fig. 1).\nConsider waypoint i located between E, and Ep. Let 4; denote the dis-\ntance between waypoint i and E;, and y; be the distance between way-\npoint i and E2. Each segment consists of several waypoints, and each of\nthe waypoints may be associated with a different priority in terms of the\nrisk level for penetration. There can be numerous scanning patterns for\ndrone surveillance for the segment, especially, when there are multiple"
