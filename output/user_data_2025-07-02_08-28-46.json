Tang and Shin extract an energy map representing a combination of a\nto taserinents gradient map in which the structure exists and a prominent map that determines the attraction of the region.

They realize image fusion using an improved weighting method.\n5 Conclusion Su et al. also proposed a new weighted fusion method called the four-section linear weighting method, which can\nBecllenation af eliminate motion ghosts to a certain extent, but which is not suitable for scenes with excessive motion. Ye et al. separate\nSen aE the background using the three frames difference method and use the seamless fusion method to fuse the background of\nthe first N\u20141 frames. They finally match and merge the last frame with the mosaic image of the previous N\u20141 frames.\nThis method can also remove motion ghosts but may lose some motion information of the previous N\u20141 frames.\n\nSGO0%\u00b0eGSEE2\u00b0 O82 G\u00ae*\n\nReferences"
