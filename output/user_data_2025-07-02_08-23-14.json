Image stitching\n2.3 Object detection\nVv 3 UAV patrol system\n3.1 System Traditional image stitching algorithms use a global homography alignment, cylindrical or spherical projection, beam ad-\narchitecture justment and multi-band fusion as their core procedures.\n32 Image stitching Zaragoza et al. [5] proposed the As-Projective-As-Possible (APAP) algorithm that introduces an idea that is based on grid\n\n3.3 Moti host\nelimination optimization for image stitching. APAP divides the image into dense grids, each grid is then aligned with a homography\n\n\u00a5 3.4 Object detection matrix called local homography. It further provides a set of efficient calculation methods called Moving DLT. A parallax-\nSay ene tolerant image stitching algorithm was proposed by Zhang and Liu which draws on the optimization item of the content-\n\n3.4.2 Quantifying preserving warps and greatly improves the stitching performance for scenes with large parallax.\n\nthe object-scene\n\nrelationship Chang et al. proposed a method called Shape-Preserving Half-Projective (SPHP) that draws on the shape-preserving\n3.4.3 Model method of image scaling from the perspective of shape correction and adds similar transformation constraints to the entire\n\nstructure\n\n4 Experiments image. It then corrects the shape of the stitched image and reduces projection distortions. Lin et al. proposed the Adap-\nY 4.1 Dataset and tive As-Natural-As-Possible (AANAP) algorithm that abandons the constraint and adaptively determines the angle.

Tang and Shin extract an energy map representing a combination of a\ngradient map in which the structure exists and a prominent map that determines the attraction of the region. They bypasses\nthe salient object when stitching with the suture. Li and Zhang [12] calculate the difference image between the two images\n\nSGO0%\u00b0eGSEE2\u00b0 O82 G\u00ae*"
