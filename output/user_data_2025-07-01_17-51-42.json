As shown in Fig. 11, the drone group\u2019s flight path is consistent with the path simulated by GAZEBO.\nAlthough drones 2 and 4 fly in another direction at the beginning, they pass through obstacles 1-3 after\nadjustment and return to the flight path of drone 1 (navigator).

It\nshows that the drone group can fly according to the planned path and complete the cruising process.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThis study is consistent with Zhou et al.\u2019\u201d and Yin et al.\u2019 in terms of path planning and obstacle avoidance, but\nby introducing a virtual navigator and reinforcement learning algorithm, it achieves higher accuracy and greater\nadaptability. improvements. Compared with the studies of Meng et al.\u2019 and Chen et al.\u2019\u00ae, this study optimized the\ncluster collaboration mechanism, enabling drones to maintain consistency and stability in complex agricultural\nscenarios. Combining the smart agriculture results of Lu et al.*' and Li et al.'\u2019, this study focuses on the specific\napplication scenario of durian orchards and designs a more practical optimization strategy. Compared with the\ndynamic modeling studies of Zhou et al.'\u00b0 and Chen et al.\u2019*, this study shows stronger robustness in dynamic\nenvironments. Based on Yin et al.\u201d and Ji et al.**, this study significantly improved the efficiency and real-time\nperformance of the algorithm through distributed control strategy and experience replay mechanism. Through\nthe above experimental results, the EN-MASCA algorithm performs better than other algorithms in multiple\ndimensions such as flight trajectory deviation, altitude change stability, and flight speed range, demonstrating\ngood accuracy and stability. In terms of relative distance consistency and safe distance control between cluster\ncenter and obstacles, EN-MASCA significantly outperforms MASCA, NNCA and NSGAII, indicating that it is\n\nScientific Reports |\n\n(2025) 15:9139 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-88145-7 nature portfolio\n\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/"
