Sensitivity analysis\n\nThis section analyzes the model behavior by changing some\nparameter values as well as the objective function of the model.\n\n4.3.1. Number of waypoints and model performance\n\nIn this study, we have assumed that each location at the borderline\nhas a given revisiting gap. However, the model considers given revisit-\ning gaps only for waypoints. Thus, increasing the number of waypoints\nmay enhance the accuracy of the model and allow for the assignment of\ndrones to more specific areas. However, having a higher number of\nwaypoints makes it computationally more difficult to solve the model\ndue to the increase in problem size (see ). The case study was\nused to compare the CPU times for solving the model with and without\nusing shows the improvement in the speed of the\nmodel for solving the problem after using the heuristic algorithm.\n\nIt is observed in that solving the cases that included more\nwaypoints resulted in higher CPU times.
