Optimal solution of the problem based on different values of Co and C; considering i = 5% *CS: Candidate solutions presented in Table 7.\n\ndrone type is given, the optimal solution in the case of the higher E-line\ninstallation cost is the candidate solution with the shortest length of the\nE-line and a greater amount of required drones (i.e., CS1 or CSs).\nHowever, increasing the drone operation cost while fixing the E-line\ninstallation cost results in choosing the candidate solutions with fewer\ndrones and more E-line (i.e., CS4 and CSg).\n\n5. Conclusion\n\nThe U.S. has spent a significant amount of funds to secure its national\nborders. Border patrol requires many patrol agents who are assigned to\ndifferent segments of the border. These patrol agents spend hours a day\ndriving and hiking mostly uninhabited grasslands and mountain ranges,\nexposing them to dangerous environments. To enhance the security of\nthe national borders and reduce the need for patrolling via human\nagents, this paper proposed the use of drones coupled with the use of E-\nlines for continuous border surveillance. Because different segments of\nthe border exhibited different risk levels for invasion, this paper\n\n6\n\ndrones fly at lower speeds while passing the E-line. It was proved that\nfixing the drones\u2019 E-line passing speed allows the model to simulta-\nneously minimize the number of drones and the total length of the E-\nline. Through this, we could eliminate the nonlinearity of the model and\nreduce the computation time and complexity. An algorithm was devel-\noped to find the candidate E-line passing speeds that provide Pareto-\noptimal solutions. Among these Pareto-optimal solutions given, the\ndecision-makers can determine the optimal solution based on their\nfinancial strategies. Moreover, a heuristic algorithm was proposed to\nprovide a proper initial solution for the model in order to accelerate the\nsolving procedure. In the numerical example section, a case study of the\nU.S.-Mexico border was used to illustrate the model performance. The\nnumerical results support that continuous surveillance of the borderline\ncould be realized by the implementation of the drones and the E-line. A\nsensitivity analysis was performed to examine and elaborate on the\nmodel behavior under different scenarios. Additionally, a cost analysis\nwas provided to facilitate the decision-making process for adopting this\napproach. For future work, one can consider both the dynamic and static\n\nSe20 oe Af"
