While disagreements happen, we should stay mindful of our shared goals and the one thing\nthat binds us all: we\u2019re students building ourselves in a place far away from home, and all we have is each other - striving to take student leadership forward with the admin.\n\nMore\n\nLabels On that note, | also want to address a concern many of us face each sem end: the current SWD website, especially when it comes to checking semester dues.\n\nTo upgrade your experience, | wanted to share a small effort - the new Enhancer Extension, giving a better interface to make it easier for you to view your semester dues and arrears. Whether it\u2019s services like suit, cab\nbookings, or events from the FoodFest and APOGEE, you can now quickly check any outstanding amounts on a cleaner, more user-friendly page.\n\nYou can easily add the extension to your browser using the links below. | am also for the tech guys. Feel free to modify it, load it manually, or simply go through the code itself.\n\n\u00a2 Chrome Extension :\ne Firefox Extension :\ne Microsoft Edge Extension :\n\nSharma Ji Dues.png\n\n| hope this helps you track your expenses and prevent unnecessary charges, and if you\u2019re able to clarify or save even a little money, I\u2019d be glad to know this initiative made a difference.\n\nSGO00eGBE2S OOOO eh BF"
