Hence, a permitted revisiting gap can be inter-\npreted as the time interval a drone can be away from a particular\nlocation during the surveillance operation, and it is given to the opti-\nmization model as an input parameter.\n\nBorders form continuous lines and may not have physical waypoints\nor breakpoints at every location. Hence, we assume equally-spaced\nwaypoints distributed over the borderline for the convenience of\ndeveloping a mathematical model. As the drone can fly over any objects\non the ground, these points serve as virtual locations for the user to be\nable to control flight segments and the frequency of visits by drones.\nHaving many (virtual) waypoints over the borderline (i.e., a higher\nresolution) can improve the accuracy of the model. But, it comes at the\ncost of a higher computational complexity for solving the optimization\nmodel. This is because, as the resolution increases, the corresponding\nnumber of variables in the optimization model increases significantly.\nThus, we aim to find a sufficient number of waypoints to have a\nreasonable trade-off between the model accuracy and the computational\ncomplexity.\n\nThe following assumptions are made to develop the optimization\nmodel:\n\n- The borderline will be divided into multiple border segments, and a\ndrone will be assigned to each segment. This action assists in con-\ntrolling the drones as well as avoiding the chances that more than\none drone will visit any one location and collision among the drones\n( ).\n\n- Each location on the border has a pre-assigned revisiting gap. This\ngap may differ based on the location. The locations with higher\n\nS80\n\nwaypoints and the priority level (i.e., risk) of eac\neach other. We define a scanning pattern of a dro\nof drone flights that leaves a starting point, s\nreturns back to the starting point to complete one flight cycle, which will\nbe repeated by the drone during the assigned surveillance operation\nperiod. Some example scanning patterns include\nPi := <1i-E, -i\u2014E, \u2014-E, -i>,p2 := < E, -i\u2014E,) \u2014i\u2014E, \u2014i\u2014-E, >, and\np3 := <i\u2014E,\u2014i-\u2014E, \u2014i>. Patterns p; and p2 can be appealing if the\npriority of waypoints between i and E, is higher than the priority for the\nright sub-segment between E; and i. Hence, a scanning pattern selection\napproach is proposed to choose one of the many possible scanning\npatterns, which results in the minimum revising gap for a drone to fly\nrepeatedly following the pattern.\n\nWe define ? as the set of possible scanning patterns for the drone to\nscan a given area. In , let t;, be the flight time between waypoint i\nand E), and t,, be the flight time between waypoint i and E>. Following a\nfixed flight pattern p, the drone\u2019s revising gap to a specific waypoint i\nmaybe different from one visit to the next. Our goal is to ensure that each\nwaypoint is visited as frequently as possible, which can be accomplished\nby minimizing the maximum gap among all possible revisiting gaps\ngenerated by a fixed scanning pattern. Let G;;(p) be the time interval\n\nShow all\n\nbetween the k* and (k + 1)* visits of waypoint i following pattern p \u20ac P,\na collection of all possible scanning patterns.
