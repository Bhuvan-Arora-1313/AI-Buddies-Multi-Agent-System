Number of waypoints and model performance\n\nIn this study, we have assumed that each location at the borderline\nhas a given revisiting gap. However, the model considers given revisit-\ning gaps only for waypoints. Thus, increasing the number of waypoints\nmay enhance the accuracy of the model and allow for the assignment of\ndrones to more specific areas. However, having a higher number of\nwaypoints makes it computationally more difficult to solve the model\n\ndue to the increase in problem size (see ).
