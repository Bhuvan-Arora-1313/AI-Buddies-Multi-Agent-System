You can create a key for free with a few clicks in Google Al Studio.\n\nModels Once you have an API key, you have the following options to connect to the Gemini API:\nAll models \u00a2 Setting your API key as an environment variable\n\nPricing .\n\nRate limits e Providing your API key explicitly\n\nBilling info\n\nModel Capabilities\n\nText generation\nImage generation\nVideo generation\nSpeech generation A\nMusic generation A\nLong context\nStructured output\nThinking\n\nFunction calling\nDocument understanding\nImage understanding\nVideo understanding\nAudio understanding\n\nCode execution\n\nURL context A\n\nFor initial testing, you can hard code an API key, but this should only be temporary since it's not secure. You can find examples for hard coding\nthe API key in Providing API key explicitly section.\n\nSetting API key as environment variable\n\nIf you set the environment variable GEMINI_API_KEY or GOOGLE_API_KEY , the API key will automatically be picked up by the client when using\none of the Gemini API libraries. It's recommended that you set only one of those variables, but if both are set, GOOGLE_API_KEY takes\nprecedence.\n\nIf you're using the REST API, or JavaScript on the browser, you will need to provide the API key explicitly.\n\nHere is how you can set your API key locally as the environment variable GEMINI_API_KEY with different operating systems.\nLinux/macOS - Bash macOS - Zsh Windows\n\nBash is a common Linux and macOS terminal configuration. You can check if you have a configuration file for it by running the following\ncommand:\n\n\u00a9 0\n\n28O\u00b0EGSE2\u00b00 OD2\u00b010 Ff\n\nBest practices"
