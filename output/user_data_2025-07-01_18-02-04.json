Wang et al.'? proposed a drone-assisted\nURLLC scheme for edge users, using information age as an indicator of system delay to achieve the performance\nrequirements of ultra-reliable low-latency communication. Gao et al.\u201d\u00b0 obtained the modeling parameters of the\ntheoretical closed-form energy model based on the ing literature based on the curve fitting of the model, and\nproposed a theoretical energy model for rotorcraft UAVs. Yin et al.*! constructed the autonomous navigation of\nUAVs in a three-dimensional environment with adaptive control as a Markov decision process, and proposed\na deep reinforcement learning algorithm. They also proposed a new speed constraint loss function and added\nit to the original actor loss to improve the speed control ability of the UAV. Zhang et al.\u201d proposed an adaptive\npseudo-inverse control scheme based on fuzzy logic system (FLS) and barrier Lyapunov function (BLF) for a\nclass of state-constrained hysteresis nonlinear systems, which showed great application potential in the fields\nof soft bionic robots and rehabilitation robots. Ji et al.?* proposed a multi-agent deterministic policy gradient\n(MADPG) method based on an actor-critic network, and proved its convergence and optimalit minimizing\nthe local cost (Q-function), thereby improving the data utilization of the network. Liang et al.* proposed an\nintegrated framework that combines three basic modules (such as the behavior decision-making, path planning,\nand motion control modules) to improve the safety of AVs in mixed traffic high-speed cruising scenarios.\n\nLiterature conclusion\n\nCompares the EN-MASCA algorithm with other studies in the main findings, quantitative results, and key\nsimilar\u2019 and differences, although these studies (such as''!*!7?!) also combine reinforcement learning, deep\nlearning or hybrid modeling techniques to improve model performance like this study, they aim to optimize\npath planning, obstacle avoidance and task completion efficiency through advanced algorithms.

Table 1 shows the comparison results of the EN-MASCA algorithm with some key\nstudies.\n\n\u2018The above studies are similar to this study in terms of overall goals, and both aim to improve the navigation,\npath planning and task completion efficiency of drone swarms through advanced algorithms. They lay the\ntheoretical foundation for this study, especially in terms of reinforcement learning, dynamic path planning and\ngroup behavior modeling. Most of them use reinforcement learning, deep neural networks, heuristic algorithms,\netc. for path planning and obstacle avoidance. Some studies combine task allocation or data fusion technology\nto improve algorithm performance. Although they have achieved some success, most of them are aimed at\nideal or relatively simple optimization path planning and task allocation, and lack applicability in the complex\ndynamic environments (such as agricultural scenes or high-density obstacle environments). Some studies are\ndifficult to meet the requirements of real-time and efficient computing in practical applications due to the high\ncomplexity of the algorithm or the need for large-scale computing resources. Other studies focus on generalized\ntask planning and navigation problems, lack optimization design for specific fields (such as agricultural drone\npatrols, disaster monitoring, etc.), and cannot fully meet the needs of the field. Therefore, this study designed a\nvirtual navigator model and a six-degree- eedom drone motion simulation model, and achieved real-time\npath optimization and efficient collaboration by introducing an enhanced multi-agent cluster control algorithm.\n(EN-MASCA) and integrating DQN and PPO algorithms. It solves the problem of poor adaptability of the above\nmethods in complex scenarios, and greatly improves the stability and efficiency of drone clusters in complex\nagricultural scenarios such as durian orchards.\n\nMethods and materials\nDrone model construction\n\u2018This study combines ROS with the GAZEBO physical simulation platform'\u00ae, which controls the drone to obtain\nthe sensor data through ROS and builds a 3D simulation model of the drone. It also introduces the PX4 flight\ncontrol system, which is divided into the human-computer interaction layer, cluster algorithm layer, PX4 flight\ncal simulation layer. The top layer, such as the ground station or off board node, will\noutput the desired state of the drone and pass it to the PX4 flight control layer\u2019\u2019. Finally, the flight controller\ntransmits its attitude information to the GAZEBO simulator for 3D display. In order to control the drones in the\ncluster, this study sets the three variables of speed Vi, yaw angle Ri and altitude Hj. The pitch angle, yaw angle\nand throttle are used to control the PX4 flight control. In order to enable the clustering algorithm to control the\nPX4, this study converts the output command into the input command of the PX4 flight control attitude loop.\n\nNeuromorphic computing technology, exploring\npotential applications in smart agri\n\nnnfigurable intelligent agricultural robotic\narm (CARA), integrating image acquisition and deep\nprocessing modules\n\nHybrid architecture combining data-driven models and\nphysical models for parameter identification and error\ncharacterization\n\nSpatial attention mechanism and feature fusion module,\ncombined with hybrid models of physical and dual\nattention neural networks\n\nMobile navigation combined with visual perception,\npath planning and obstacle avoidance\n\nCentroid Voronoi tessellation .d path\nentation method for brain-controlled robot\n\ncomputing for data processing\noptimization; proposes future development\n\nImproves precisio\nagricultural tasks\nAchieved accurate and interpretable\n\nnodeling, providing a reliable model for\n\nImproves modeling accuracy in complex\ndynamic environments with limited data\n\nAchieved human-preference-based task\niment and efficient navigation\n\nProvides efficient path segmentati\nsenerating arbitrary target navig\n\nprovided\n\nExecution efficiency improved by\n20%, error rate reduced by 15\n\nParameter identification error\nreduced by 10-15%\n\nPrediction accuracy improved by\n~ 12-18%\n\n\u00bb\n\nSearch\n\nge Paper_66-\n\npen.pdf A_Patro\n\nicle1.pdf\n\nNew Script\n\nSecurity Drone\nfor Surv...litary.pdf\n\nNew Project\n\nOpen\n\nClone Repository\n\nin\n\noD 08 \u2122%\nal\n\nPopup JSON Viewer >\n\nbash\n\ngit add output_popup.py\ngit add.\n\nVY Commit the changes:\nbash\n\ngit commit -\n\n@ Push to GitHub:\n\nbash\n\ngit push\n\n3 That's it!\n\nYour GitHub repo is now up to date with:\n\nV) The new popup script\n\n\u2018 The updated gatheruserdata logic\n\n.
