This action assists in con-\ntrolling the drones as well as avoiding the chances that more than\none drone will visit any one location and collision among the drones\n( ).\n\n- Each location on the border has a pre-assigned revisiting gap. This\ngap may differ based on the location. The locations with higher\npriority are assigned a shorter revisiting gap in order to enhance\nsecurity.\n\n- The battery discharging rate is constant, but the charging efficiency\nis a function of the drone speed]\n\nIn addition to the above assumptions, we suggest two different\nspeeds during their flights: the nominal speed for normal operation and\nthe charging mode speed for flying while being charged (i.e., flying\nabove the E-line). To lessen the revisiting gap, drones should use their\nnominal speed while passing segments not covered by the E-line; how-\never, they may reduce the speed when flying over the E-line to have\nmore time to recharge their battery.\n\nThis problem involves several variables to be determined using an\noptimization model, which includes a sufficient number of drones, the\ntotal length of the E-line system, the speed of the drones, and the\nscanning pattern of each drone. However, the resulting mathematical\n\nand FE), and t,, be the flight time between waypoi e\nfixed flight pattern p, the drone\u2019s revising gap t\nmaybe different from one visit to the next.
