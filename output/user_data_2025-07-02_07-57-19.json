Lim\u2019, Maryam Torabbeigi*, Seon Jin Kim \u2018\n\n* Department of Industrial Engineering, University of Houston, TX, United States\n> Department of Industrial Engineering, University of Houston, Houston, TX 77204, United States\n\u00a9 Republic of Korea Army, South Korea\n\nARTICLE INFO ABSTRACT\n\nKeywords:\n\nSmart border patrol\nBorder surveillance\nDrones\n\nWireless charging system\n\nHarsh environmental factors surrounding the national borders as well as their extensive length make the use of\nmanned systems for monitoring every location on the border a risky, expensive, and hardly possible task. Smart\nborder patrol using small-size drones may provide significant help in patrolling areas inaccessible to patrol\nagents, reduce agent response time, and increase the safety of patrol agents working in dangerous regions.\nHowever, the short flight duration associated with small-size drones due to battery limitation can be a serious\ndrawback for such a system for seamless surveillance. Therefore, this paper proposes a drone-based continuous\nsurveillance system for border patrol with a dynamic wireless battery charging system that is built onto an\nelectrification line (E-line). To control the maximum time interval between two consecutive flights to a particular\nsection of the border, a permitted revisiting gap is assigned to each location on the border based on its criticality.\nA multi-objective mixed-integer non-linear programming (MINLP) model is developed to minimize both the total\nlength of the E-line system for the wireless charging system and the number of drones to satisfy the revisiting gap\nconstraint for a secure border patrol. A solution algorithm is proposed to achieve the Pardto-optimal set. This\nmethod provides the decision-maker with a set of candidate solutions to choose from based on their priorities and\nbudgetary constraints. We illustrate our method using a case study on a segment of the US-Mexico borderline.\n\n\\E8E8C OO B\u00ae"
