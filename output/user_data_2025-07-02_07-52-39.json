There are two key issues in drone patrol: 1) showing the patrolling scene in\na simple and intuitive manner; 2) detecting and highlighting objects of interest. To this\nend, we propose a UAV patrol system based on panoramic image stitching and object\ndetection. This system uses the SPHP algorithm combined with the region growing\nalgorithm based on difference images to generate a panorama image and to eliminate\nmotion ghosts. It further adopts the popular image object detector Faster RCNN to detect\nobjects while using knowledge about the scene categories to refine the classification\nscores of the objects. The proposed system is evaluated on the VisDrone video detection\ndataset. The experiments show that the system provides good results regarding\npanoramic stitching and object detection in drone videos.\n\nIntroduction\n\nJUL \u00a9 1\nube 4\n\n\u00a9 eoe\n\na\u201d\n\nei\nSearch ScienceDirect 2 |\nPart of special issue \u201cA\n\nArtificial Intelligence and Computer\nVision\nEdited by Huimin Lu, Hu Zhu, Limei Peng\n\nView special issue\n\nRecommended articles \u201cA\n\n3D porous network gel polymer electrolyte\nwith high transference number for...\n\nSolid State Ionics, Volume 343, 2019, Article 115088\nTingshuai Yang, ..., Jianping Long\n\nPrivacy-preserving content-based image\nretrieval for mobile computing\n\nJournal of Information Security and Applications, Volu...\n\nYong Wang, ..., Wenbin Lu\n\nDevelopment of Lentiviral Vectors for HIV-1\nGene Therapy with Vif-Resistant APOBEC3G\n\nMolecular Therapy Nucleic Acids, Volume 18, 2019, pp....\nKrista A.
