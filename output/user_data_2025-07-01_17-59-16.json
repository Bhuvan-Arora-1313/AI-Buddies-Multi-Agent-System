It introduces DQN and PPO algorithms to optimize drones\u2019\nnavigation and obstacle avoidance strategies. It guides the drone swarm through the virtual navigator model\nto improve its adaptability and stability. It also constructs a six-degree-of-freedom drone motion simulation\nmodel and uses the PI control loop to achieve the attitude control of drone swarms. Compared with MASCA,\nNNCA and NSGAII algorithms, the results show that the EN-MASCA algorithm is superior to the other three\nalgorithms regarding flight trajectory, flight stability, cluster_stability and simulation effect. The drone swarm\n\ncontrolled by the EN-MASCA algorithm can effectively avoid obstacles| maintain a tight formation and\n\ncomplete patrol tasks.
