While disagreements happen, we should stay mindful of our shared goals and the one thing\n\nd that binds us all: we\u2019re students building ourselves in a place far away from home, and all we have is each other - striving to take student leadership forward with the admin.\nSnooze\n\nOn that note, | also want to address a concern many of us face each sem end: the current SWD website, especially when it comes to checking semester dues.\n\nSent ~\nOo\nft To upgrade your experience, | wanted to share a small effort - the new Enhancer Extension, giving a better interface to make it easier for you to view your semester dues and arrears. Whether it\u2019s services like suit, cab\nDratts bookings, or events from the FoodFest and APOGEE, you can now quickly check any outstanding amounts on a cleaner, more user-friendly page.\nMore You can easily add the extension to your browser using the links below. | am also for the tech guys.

To campaign, they must step into the public eye, risking personal attacks and memes that can get out of hand. This cycle often breeds conflict and chaos.\nMembers of departments and clubs, and countless volunteers continue to give their best despite the politics around them, and they deserve our appreciation for their commitment to keeping things moving.
